## Use memo

- useMemo is a React hook that stores the result of a function and only recalculates it when its dependencies change, helping to make the app faster.

## useCallback

- useCallback is a React hook that remembers a function so it doesnâ€™t get recreated every time the component re-renders, unless its dependencies change.

## useRef
- like a document.querySelcetor
